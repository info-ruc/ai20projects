This study describes the social and demographic profile of the first generation of users of marketed virtual reality (VR) viewers in Spain and, subsequently, it assesses the interest in its use as a learning tool. For that purpose, an online questionnaire created ad hoc was administered to a sample of 117 participants. The relationship between twelve variables was analysed comparing means through the Snedecor's F distribution and the contingency tables through the Chi-squared test and Somers' D. Among other issues, it was concluded that the virtual reality user profile at present corresponds to a person older than 36, mainly men, with higher education and having acquired their viewer no longer than one year ago. Concerning the interests of virtual reality users as a learning tool, only a few of them currently use virtual reality for this aim, but they mainly show an interest in using the virtual reality as a learning method and they feel optimism regarding the future use of this technology as a learning tool. However, this is not the case among users of video game consoles (PSVR), who are mainly men not interested in their use as a learning tool at present. Finally, it can be stated that current use as a learning tool among teachers and students is occasional and preferably via smartphones.
