The explosive growth of mobile technology and developments in cloud computing have provided new and powerful possibilities for mobile learning (m-learning). M-learning, which is an influential trend in the educational process, promotes learning accessibility and flexibility for a substantial and valuable segment of society: students with dyslexia. Although there is a substantial amount of research that discusses the use of m-learning by students with dyslexia, there are many gaps that must still be addressed. One substantial issue pertains to the lack of an effective, multimodal, human–computer user interface m-learning tool that combines different input and output modes based on each student's learning style. In this paper, the authors develop a novel, interactive, multimodal interfaced, cloud-based m-learning tool with which students can naturally interact based on their preferred learning styles. This multimodal interface tool enhances the learning capabilities of students with dyslexia by almost 30% by customizing their multimodal functionality to meet their learning needs.
