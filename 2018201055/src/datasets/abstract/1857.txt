Cloud computing environment support resource sharing as cloud service over the internet. It enables the users to outsource data into the cloud server that can be accessed remotely from various devices distributed geographically. Accessing resources from the cloud causes various security issues as the attackers try to illegally access the data. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one of the security concern in the cloud server. DDoS is a kind of cyber attack which disrupt normal traffic of targeted cloud server (or any other servers). In this paper, we propose an effective fuzzy and taylor-elephant herd optimization (FT-EHO) inspired by deep belief network (DBN) classifier for detecting the DDoS attack. FT-EHO uses taylor series and elephant heard optimization algorithm along with a fuzzy classifier for rules learning. The performance of the proposed FT-EHO is evaluated through rigorous computer simulations. Three standard benchmark databases, namely, KDD cup, database1 and database2 are used during simulations. Four quality measures such as accuracy, detection accuracy,​ precision and recall are considered as a performance metrics. FT-EHO’s performance is compared against the state-of-the-art methods considering the evaluation metrics. Results reveals that the proposed FT-EHO showed significantly higher value of evaluation metrics (accuracy (93.811%), detection rate (97.200%), precision (94.981%) and recall (93.833%)) as compared to other methods.
