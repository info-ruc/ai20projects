Science gateways often rely on workflow engines to execute applications on distributed infrastructures. We investigate six software architectures commonly used to integrate workflow engines into science gateways. In tight integration, the workflow engine shares software components with the science gateway. In service invocation, the engine is isolated and invoked through a specific software interface. In task encapsulation, the engine is wrapped as a computing task executed on the infrastructure. In the pool model, the engine is bundled in an agent that connects to a central pool to fetch and execute workflows. In nested workflows, the engine is integrated as a child process of another engine. In workflow conversion, the engine is integrated through workflow language conversion. We describe and evaluate these architectures with metrics for assessment of integration complexity, robustness, extensibility, scalability and functionality. Tight integration and task encapsulation are the easiest to integrate and the most robust. Extensibility is equivalent in most architectures. The pool model is the most scalable one and meta-workflows are only available in nested workflows and workflow conversion. These results provide insights for science gateway architects and developers.
