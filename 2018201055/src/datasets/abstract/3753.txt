A large amount of digital image material is routinely captured during esophagogastroduodenoscopies but, for the most part, is not used for confirming the diagnosis process of celiac disease which is primarily based on histological examination of biopsies. Recently, considerable effort has been undertaken to make use of image material by developing semi- or fully-automated systems to improve the diagnostic workup. Recently, focus was especially laid on developing state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, exploiting the endoscopist’s expert knowledge and on making systems fully automated and thereby completely observer independent. In this work, we summarize recent trends in the field of computer-aided celiac disease diagnosis based on upper endoscopy and discuss about recent progress, remaining challenges, limitations currently prohibiting a deployment in clinical practice and future efforts to tackle them.
