This study investigates coding features from cutting-edge multimedia technologies related to second language (L2) learning. The participants were fifty undergraduate students who were exposed to novel L2 words via three interfaces in the Computer-Assisted Vocabulary Acquisition software (CAVA): a verbal-based menu driven interface (L2-L1: MDI), a visual-based graphical user interface (L2-Picture: GUI), and a visuospatial-based zoomable user interface (L2-Context: ZUI). Immediate and delayed post-tests were conducted. The results for the immediate post-test revealed ZUI to be the most effective multimedia learning method. However, in the delayed post-test, ZUI’s effect declined dramatically, while GUI proved the most effective interface.
