To understand the impact of learner metacognition and goal orientation on problem-solving, this study investigated 159 undergraduate students’ metacognition, goal orientations, and their problem-solving performances and processes in a laboratory setting using a Serious Game (SG) environment that adopts problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy to teach space science. Utilizing cluster analysis, multiple regression, similarity measure and data visualization, this study analyzed multiple data sources, including computer log data, problem-solving performance scores, and survey data. The results show that both learner metacognition and goal orientation affected problem-solving. The findings of this study offer insights of how learner characteristics impact on problem-solving in SG environments with PBL pedagogy. It also contributes to understanding the design of SG environments to benefit learners based on their metacognitive levels.
