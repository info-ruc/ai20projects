The object tracking in video surveillance for intelligent traffic handling in smart cities requires an enormous amount of data called big data to be transmitted over the network using the Internet of Things. Manual monitoring and surveillance are impossible because traditional computer vision technologies are no more useful for massive processing and intelligent decision making. In this paper, a framework is proposed which enables both on spot data processing and intelligent decision making by using cloud computing. The developed application is a trained on Artificial Neural Network, which can handle different traffic techniques with congested traffic scenario and priorities traffic such as ambulance handling. The Message Queue Telemetry Transport protocol is used for green transmission with mobile access to traffic data. The results analyzed with thirty videos processed data which handle real-time data prioritization for the people for smart surveillance to fastest route and enhance the intelligent data transmission.
