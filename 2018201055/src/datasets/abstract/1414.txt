In the era of big data astronomy, next generation telescopes and large sky surveys produce data sets at the TB or even PB level. Due to their large data volumes, these astronomical data sets are extremely difficult to transfer and analyze using personal computers or small clusters. In order to offer better access to data, data centers now generally provide online science platforms that enable analysis close to the data. The Chinese Virtual Observatory (China-VO) is one of the member projects in the International Virtual Observatory Alliance and it is dedicated to providing a research and education environment where globally distributed astronomy archives are simple to find, access, and interoperate. In this study, we summarize highlights of the work conducted at the China-VO, as well the experiences and lessons learned during the full life-cycle management of astronomical data. Finally, We discuss the challenges and future trends for astronomical science platforms.
