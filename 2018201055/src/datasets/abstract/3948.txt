Dental imaging has seen a rapid technological advance over the last several years. Not only has most x-ray based diagnostic technology been digitized, with the possibility of low dose 3D computed tomography imaging, but many novel optical imaging techniques have now also been adopted in a more therapeutic imaging of the dental patient. When combining and manipulating such different digital image data, clinicians can now easily plan and simulate treatments on-screen, use 3D printed models and aids to assist in accurate transfer of the virtual planning or even follow-up their treatments over time. However, it seems that knowledge on digital technology is still lacking in clinical practice, which may contribute to errors or slow adoption. The purpose of this article is to bring an overview of the digitalization of dental imaging techniques and inform dental professionals on the digital tools that are available for the follow-up of patient treatments.
